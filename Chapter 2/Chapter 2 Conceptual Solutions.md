Exercise 2.1: In ![$\varepsilon$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cvarepsilon%24)-greedy action selection, for the case of two actions and ![$\varepsilon = 0.5$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cvarepsilon%20%3D%200.5%24), what is the probability that the greedy action is selected?

With ![$\varepsilon = 0.5$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cvarepsilon%20%3D%200.5%24) and two actions, the probability that the greedy action is immediately taken is 50%, and the probability that a randomly selected action is taken is 50% (with all actions equally probable for being selected in the random selection).  Thus, the probability that the greedy action is taken is 50% + 50%*(1/2) = 75%.

Exercise 2.2 (Bandit example): Consider a ![$k$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24k%24)-armed bandit problem with ![$k=4$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24k%3D4%24) actions, denoted 1, 2, 3, and 4. Consider applying to this problem a bandit algorithm using ![$\varepsilon$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cvarepsilon%24)-greedy action selection, sample-average action-value estimates, and initial estimates of ![$Q_1(a)=0$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q_1(a)%3D0%24), for all ![$a$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24a%24). Suppose the initial sequence of actions and rewards is ![$A_1 = 1, R_1 = -1, A_2 = 2, R_2 = 1, A_3 = 2, R_3 = -2, A_4 = 2, R_4 = 2, A_5 = 3, R_5 = 0$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24A_1%20%3D%201%2C%20R_1%20%3D%20-1%2C%20A_2%20%3D%202%2C%20R_2%20%3D%201%2C%20A_3%20%3D%202%2C%20R_3%20%3D%20-2%2C%20A_4%20%3D%202%2C%20R_4%20%3D%202%2C%20A_5%20%3D%203%2C%20R_5%20%3D%200%24). On some of these time steps the ![$\varepsilon$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cvarepsilon%24) case may have occurred, causing an action to be selected at random. On which time steps did this definitely occur? On which time steps could this possibly have occurred?

Prior to the first action, all estimates ![$Q_1(a)$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q_1(a)%24) are initialized to 0.  The selection of action 1 is possibly an occurrence of the ![$\varepsilon$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cvarepsilon%24) case but not definitely, because action 1 has the highest estimated reward but with a reward value that equals other actions.  Once ![$R_1 = -1$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24R_1%20%3D%20-1%24) is returned, the sample-average action-value estimate of action 1 is updated (![$Q_2(a=1) = 0 + \frac{1}{2}\[-1 - 0\] = -0.5$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q_2(a%3D1)%20%3D%200%20%2B%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5B-1%20-%200%5D%20%3D%20-0.5%24)) without changing any of the other ![$Q$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q%24) values.  For the second action, the selection of action 2 could possibly be an occurrence of the ![$\varepsilon$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cvarepsilon%24) case but not definitely, because action 2 has the highest estimated reward but with a reward value that equals other actions.  Once ![$R_2 = 1$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24R_2%20%3D%201%24) is returned, the sample-average action-value estimate of action 2 is updated (![$Q_2(a=2) = 0 + \frac{1}{2}\[1 - 0\] = 0.5$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q_2(a%3D2)%20%3D%200%20%2B%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5B1%20-%200%5D%20%3D%200.5%24)) without changing any of the other ![$Q$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q%24) values.  For the third action, the selection of action 3 is definitely an occurrence of the ![$\varepsilon$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cvarepsilon%24) case because action 2 is estimated to have a higher reward than action 3 (i.e., ![$Q_2(a=2) > Q_1(a=3)$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q_2(a%3D2)%20%3E%20Q_1(a%3D3)%24)) but action 3 was taken anyway.  Once ![$R_3 = -2$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24R_3%20%3D%20-2%24) is returned, the sample-average action-value estimate of action 3 is updated (![$Q_2(a=3) = 0 + \frac{1}{2}\[-2 - 0\] = -1$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q_2(a%3D3)%20%3D%200%20%2B%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5B-2%20-%200%5D%20%3D%20-1%24)) without changing any of the other ![$Q$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q%24) values.  For the fourth action, the selection of action 4 is definitely an occurrence of the ![$\varepsilon$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cvarepsilon%24) case because action 2 is estimated to have a higher reward than action 4 (i.e., ![$Q_2(a=2) > Q_1(a=4)$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q_2(a%3D2)%20%3E%20Q_1(a%3D4)%24)) but action 4 was taken anyway.  Once ![$R_4 = 2$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24R_4%20%3D%202%24) is returned, the sample-average action-value estimate of action 4 is updated (![$Q_2(a=4) = 0 + \frac{1}{2}\[2 - 0\] = 1$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q_2(a%3D4)%20%3D%200%20%2B%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5B2%20-%200%5D%20%3D%201%24)) without changing any of the other ![$Q$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q%24) values.  For the fifth action, the selection of action 3 is definitely an occurrence of the ![$\varepsilon$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cvarepsilon%24) case because action 4 is estimated to have a higher reward than action 3 (i.e., ![$Q_2(a=4) > Q_2(a=3)$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q_2(a%3D4)%20%3E%20Q_2(a%3D3)%24)) but action 3 was taken anyway.  Once ![$R_5 = 0$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24R_5%20%3D%200%24) is returned, the sample-average action-value estimate of action 3 is updated (![$Q_3(a=3) = -1 + \frac{1}{3}\[0 - (-1)\] = -0.67$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q_3(a%3D3)%20%3D%20-1%20%2B%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%5B0%20-%20(-1)%5D%20%3D%20-0.67%24)) without changing any of the other ![$Q$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q%24) values.

Exercise 2.3: In the comparison shown in Figure 2.2, which method will perform best in the long run in terms of cumulative reward and probability of selecting the best action? How much better will it be? Express your answer quantitatively.

In the long run, the strategy with more exploration (i.e., ![$\varepsilon = 0.1$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cvarepsilon%20%3D%200.1%24)) performs better.  After 1000 plays, the ![$\varepsilon = 0.1$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cvarepsilon%20%3D%200.1%24) strategy obtains an average reward of ![$\approx 1.3$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Capprox%201.3%24) (so total reward of ![$\approx 1.3 \times 1000 = 1300$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Capprox%201.3%20%5Ctimes%201000%20%3D%201300%24)), the ![$\varepsilon=0.01$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cvarepsilon%3D0.01%24) strategy obtains an average reward of ![$\approx 1.25$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Capprox%201.25%24) (so total reward of ![$\approx 1.25 \times 1000 = 1250$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Capprox%201.25%20%5Ctimes%201000%20%3D%201250%24)), and the ![$\varepsilon=0$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cvarepsilon%3D0%24) (greedy) strategy obtains an average reward of ![$\approx 1$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Capprox%201%24) (so total reward of ![$\approx 1 \times 1000 = 1000$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Capprox%201%20%5Ctimes%201000%20%3D%201000%24)).

Exercise 2.4: If the step-size parameters, ![$\alpha_n$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Calpha_n%24), are not constant, then the estimate ![$Q_n$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q_n%24) is a weighted average of previously received rewards with a weighting different from that given by (2.6). What is the weighting on each prior reward for the general case, analogous to (2.6), in terms of the sequence of step-size parameters?

For each action, the action-value estimate is updated according to ![$Q_{n+1} = Q_n + \alpha_n \[R_n - Q_{n}\]$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q_%7Bn%2B1%7D%20%3D%20Q_n%20%2B%20%5Calpha_n%20%5BR_n%20-%20Q_%7Bn%7D%5D%24).  Recursively substituting expressions for later terms in terms of early terms (e.g., expressing ![$Q_n$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q_n%24) in terms of ![$Q_{n-1}$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q_%7Bn-1%7D%24)), we obtain
 
![\begin{align*} Q_{n+1} &= Q_n + \alpha_n \[R_n - Q_n\] \\ &= \alpha_n R_n + (1 - \alpha_n) Q_n \\ &= \alpha_n R_n + (1 - \alpha_n) \[\alpha_{n-1} R_{n-1} + (1 - \alpha_{n-1}) Q_{n-1}\] \\ &= \alpha_n R_n + \alpha_{n-1} (1 - \alpha_n) R_{n-1} + (1 - \alpha_n)(1 - \alpha_{n-1}) Q_{n-1} \\ &= \alpha_n R_n + \alpha_{n-1} (1 - \alpha_n) R_{n-1} + (1 - \alpha_n)(1 - \alpha_{n-1}) \[\alpha_{n-2} R_{n-2} + (1 - \alpha_{n-2}) Q_{n-2}\] \\ &= {\cdots} \\ &= \Sigma_i^n (\alpha_i \Pi_{j=i+1}^n (1 - \alpha_j)) R_i + Q_1 \Pi_{i=1}^n (1 - \alpha_i) \end{align*}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%20Q_%7Bn%2B1%7D%20%26%3D%20Q_n%20%2B%20%5Calpha_n%20%5BR_n%20-%20Q_n%5D%20%5C%5C%20%26%3D%20%5Calpha_n%20R_n%20%2B%20(1%20-%20%5Calpha_n)%20Q_n%20%5C%5C%20%26%3D%20%5Calpha_n%20R_n%20%2B%20(1%20-%20%5Calpha_n)%20%5B%5Calpha_%7Bn-1%7D%20R_%7Bn-1%7D%20%2B%20(1%20-%20%5Calpha_%7Bn-1%7D)%20Q_%7Bn-1%7D%5D%20%5C%5C%20%26%3D%20%5Calpha_n%20R_n%20%2B%20%5Calpha_%7Bn-1%7D%20(1%20-%20%5Calpha_n)%20R_%7Bn-1%7D%20%2B%20(1%20-%20%5Calpha_n)(1%20-%20%5Calpha_%7Bn-1%7D)%20Q_%7Bn-1%7D%20%5C%5C%20%26%3D%20%5Calpha_n%20R_n%20%2B%20%5Calpha_%7Bn-1%7D%20(1%20-%20%5Calpha_n)%20R_%7Bn-1%7D%20%2B%20(1%20-%20%5Calpha_n)(1%20-%20%5Calpha_%7Bn-1%7D)%20%5B%5Calpha_%7Bn-2%7D%20R_%7Bn-2%7D%20%2B%20(1%20-%20%5Calpha_%7Bn-2%7D)%20Q_%7Bn-2%7D%5D%20%5C%5C%20%26%3D%20%7B%5Ccdots%7D%20%5C%5C%20%26%3D%20%5CSigma_i%5En%20(%5Calpha_i%20%5CPi_%7Bj%3Di%2B1%7D%5En%20(1%20-%20%5Calpha_j))%20R_i%20%2B%20Q_1%20%5CPi_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En%20(1%20-%20%5Calpha_i)%20%5Cend%7Balign*%7D)

Thus, by inspection, the weighting on the reward ![$R_k$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24R_k%24) is given by ![$\alpha_k \Pi_{j=k+1}^n (1 - \alpha_j)$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Calpha_k%20%5CPi_%7Bj%3Dk%2B1%7D%5En%20(1%20-%20%5Calpha_j)%24).

Exercise 2.6 (Mysterious Spikes): The results shown in Figure 2.3 should be quite reliable because they are averages over 2000 individual, randomly chosen 10-armed bandit tasks. Why, then, are there oscillations and spikes in the early part of the curve for the optimistic method? In other words, what might make this method perform particularly better or worse, on average, on particular early steps?

Optimistic initial values encourage exploration at early time steps by artificially inflating the estimated rewards of all bandits.  If, by chance, the truly higher reward bandits are selected during early time exploration, then the resulting sequence of plays will be exceptionally good.  On the other hand, if, by chance, the algorithm selects those bandits with rewards most artificially inflated by the optimistic initialization, then the resulting sequence of plays will be exceptionally bad.  These dynamics could lead to the observed spikes at early time steps.

Exercise 2.7 (Unbiased Constant-Step-Size Trick): In most of this chapter we have used sample averages to estimate action values because sample averages do not produce the initial bias that constant step sizes do (see the analysis leading to (2.6)). However, sample averages are not a completely satisfactory solution because they may perform poorly on nonstationary problems. Is it possible to avoid the bias of constant step sizes while retaining their advantages on nonstationary problems? One way is to use a step size of

![$\beta_n = \alpha / \bar{o}_n$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cbeta_n%20%3D%20%5Calpha%20%2F%20%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_n%24),

to process the ![$n$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24n%24)th reward for a particular action, where ![$\alpha > 0$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Calpha%20%3E%200%24) is a conventional constant step size, and ![$\bar{o}_n$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_n%24) is a trace of one that starts at 0:

![$\bar{o}_{n} = \bar{o}_{n-1} + \alpha(1 - \bar{o}_{n-1})$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_%7Bn%7D%20%3D%20%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_%7Bn-1%7D%20%2B%20%5Calpha(1%20-%20%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_%7Bn-1%7D)%24), for ![$n \geq 0$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24n%20%5Cgeq%200%24), with ![$\bar{o}_0 = 0$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_0%20%3D%200%24).

Carry out an analysis like that in (2.6) to show that ![$Q_n$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q_n%24) is an exponential recency-weighted average ![$without$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24without%24) ![$initial$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24initial%24) ![$bias$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24bias%24).

First, applying the recursion relation for ![$\bar{o}_n$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_n%24), we can find a closed form for each term in the sequence.

![\begin{align*} \bar{o}_n &= \bar{o}_{n-1} + \alpha (1 - \bar{o}_{n-1}) \\ &= \alpha + (1 - \alpha) \bar{o}_{n-1} \\ &= \alpha + (1 - \alpha) \[ \alpha + (1-\alpha) \bar{o}_{n-2} \] \\ &= \alpha + \alpha(1-\alpha) + (1-\alpha)^2 \bar{o}_{n-2}  \\ &= \alpha + \alpha(1-\alpha) + (1-\alpha)^2 \[ \alpha + (1-\alpha) \bar{o}_{n-3} \] \\ &= \alpha + \alpha(1-\alpha) + \alpha (1-\alpha)^2 + (1-\alpha)^3 \bar{o}_{n-3} \\ &= {\cdots} \\ &= \alpha \Sigma_{i=1}^n (1-\alpha)^{i-1} + (1-\alpha)^n \bar{o}_0 \\ &= \text{\{Finite geometric series\}} \\ &= \alpha \[\frac{1 - (1-\alpha)^n}{1 - (1-\alpha)}\] + (1-\alpha)^n \bar{o}_0 \\ &= 1 - (1-\alpha)^n + (1-\alpha)^n \bar{o}_0 \end{align*}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%20%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_n%20%26%3D%20%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_%7Bn-1%7D%20%2B%20%5Calpha%20(1%20-%20%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_%7Bn-1%7D)%20%5C%5C%20%26%3D%20%5Calpha%20%2B%20(1%20-%20%5Calpha)%20%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_%7Bn-1%7D%20%5C%5C%20%26%3D%20%5Calpha%20%2B%20(1%20-%20%5Calpha)%20%5B%20%5Calpha%20%2B%20(1-%5Calpha)%20%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_%7Bn-2%7D%20%5D%20%5C%5C%20%26%3D%20%5Calpha%20%2B%20%5Calpha(1-%5Calpha)%20%2B%20(1-%5Calpha)%5E2%20%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_%7Bn-2%7D%20%20%5C%5C%20%26%3D%20%5Calpha%20%2B%20%5Calpha(1-%5Calpha)%20%2B%20(1-%5Calpha)%5E2%20%5B%20%5Calpha%20%2B%20(1-%5Calpha)%20%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_%7Bn-3%7D%20%5D%20%5C%5C%20%26%3D%20%5Calpha%20%2B%20%5Calpha(1-%5Calpha)%20%2B%20%5Calpha%20(1-%5Calpha)%5E2%20%2B%20(1-%5Calpha)%5E3%20%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_%7Bn-3%7D%20%5C%5C%20%26%3D%20%7B%5Ccdots%7D%20%5C%5C%20%26%3D%20%5Calpha%20%5CSigma_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En%20(1-%5Calpha)%5E%7Bi-1%7D%20%2B%20(1-%5Calpha)%5En%20%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_0%20%5C%5C%20%26%3D%20%5Ctext%7B%5C%7BFinite%20geometric%20series%5C%7D%7D%20%5C%5C%20%26%3D%20%5Calpha%20%5B%5Cfrac%7B1%20-%20(1-%5Calpha)%5En%7D%7B1%20-%20(1-%5Calpha)%7D%5D%20%2B%20(1-%5Calpha)%5En%20%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_0%20%5C%5C%20%26%3D%201%20-%20(1-%5Calpha)%5En%20%2B%20(1-%5Calpha)%5En%20%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_0%20%5Cend%7Balign*%7D)

Using the fact that ![$\bar{o}_0 = 0$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_0%20%3D%200%24), we arrive at the closed form  ![$\bar{o}_n = 1 - (1-\alpha)^n$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cbar%7Bo%7D_n%20%3D%201%20-%20(1-%5Calpha)%5En%24), which means that ![$\beta_n = \frac{\alpha}{1-(1-\alpha)^n}$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cbeta_n%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Calpha%7D%7B1-(1-%5Calpha)%5En%7D%24).

From Exercise 2.4, the initial bias term is given as ![$Q_1 \Pi_{i=1}^n (1 - \beta_i)$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q_1%20%5CPi_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En%20(1%20-%20%5Cbeta_i)%24).  Observing that the first step size term ![$\beta_1 = \frac{\alpha}{1-(1-\alpha)^1} = 1$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cbeta_1%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Calpha%7D%7B1-(1-%5Calpha)%5E1%7D%20%3D%201%24), the first factor in the initial bias term is ![$(1 - \beta_1) = 0$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24(1%20-%20%5Cbeta_1)%20%3D%200%24), which means that the entire product in the initial bias term also vanishes.  Thus, also from Exercise 2.4, this weighting scheme corresponds to an exponential recency-weighted average given by ![$Q_{n+1} = \Sigma_i^n (\beta_i \Pi_{j=i+1}^n (1 - \beta_j)) R_i$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24Q_%7Bn%2B1%7D%20%3D%20%5CSigma_i%5En%20(%5Cbeta_i%20%5CPi_%7Bj%3Di%2B1%7D%5En%20(1%20-%20%5Cbeta_j))%20R_i%24) with no initial bias.

Exercise 2.8 (UCB Spikes): In Figure 2.4 the UCB algorithm shows a distinct spike in performance on the 11th step. Why is this? Note that for your answer to be fully satisfactory it must explain both why the reward increases on the 11th step and why it decreases on the subsequent steps. Hint: If ![$c=1$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24c%3D1%24), then the spike is less prominent.

For the 10-armed bandit shown in Figure 2.4, the first ~10 steps are going to be greedy actions, since each bandit needs to be sampled at least once for ![$N_t(a)$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24N_t(a)%24) to increment from 0 to 1 and thus for the UCB algorithm to differentiate itself over greedy selection.  If the initialized values are set optimistically to promote exploration (or if the initial values are simply initially over-estimated relative to their true values and thus initially over-exploited in greedy selection), then the UCB performance at initial time steps is analogous to optimistic greedy selection (shown in Figure 2.3, which also evinces spikes).

Exercise 2.9: Show that in the case of two actions, the soft-max distribution is the same as that given by the logistic, or sigmoid, function often used in statistics and artificial neural networks.

With two actions, the soft-max probability that action ![$a_1$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24a_1%24) is taken instead of action ![$a_2$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24a_2%24) is

![$\text{Pr}\{A_t=a_1\} = \frac{e^{H_t(a_1)}}{e^{H_t(a_1)}+e^{H_t(a_2)}} = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(H_t(a_1)-H_t(a_2))}}$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Ctext%7BPr%7D%5C%7BA_t%3Da_1%5C%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Be%5E%7BH_t(a_1)%7D%7D%7Be%5E%7BH_t(a_1)%7D%2Be%5E%7BH_t(a_2)%7D%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1%2Be%5E%7B-(H_t(a_1)-H_t(a_2))%7D%7D%24)

which is a logistic function.

Exercise 2.10: Suppose you face a 2-armed bandit task whose true action values change randomly from time step to time step. Specifically, suppose that, for any time step, the true values of actions 1 and 2 are respectively 0.1 and 0.2 with probability 0.5 (case A), and 0.9 and 0.8 with probability 0.5 (case B). If you are not able to tell which case you face at any step, what is the best expectation of success you can achieve and how should you behave to achieve it? Now suppose that on each step you are told whether you are facing case A or case B (although you still don’t know the true action values). This is an associative search task. What is the best expectation of success you can achieve in this task, and how should you behave to achieve it?

For the first situation in which we do not know which case we face at each time step, the best we can do is randomly choose either action 1 or 2 at each time step.  If we happen to be in case A, the expectation value is ![$E\[A\] = 0.5 \times 0.1 + 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.15$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24E%5BA%5D%20%3D%200.5%20%5Ctimes%200.1%20%2B%200.5%20%5Ctimes%200.2%20%3D%200.15%24); if we happen to be in case B, the expectation value is ![$E\[B\] = 0.5 \times 0.9 + 0.5 \times 0.8 = 0.85$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24E%5BB%5D%20%3D%200.5%20%5Ctimes%200.9%20%2B%200.5%20%5Ctimes%200.8%20%3D%200.85%24). Since we are in case A with probability 0.5 and case B with probability 0.5, the total expectation value in this situation is ![$0.5 \times 0.15 + 0.5 \times 0.85 = 0.5$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%240.5%20%5Ctimes%200.15%20%2B%200.5%20%5Ctimes%200.85%20%3D%200.5%24).

For the second situation in which we are told which case we face at each time step, we can perform an associative search task to learn the true values of the bandits in each case and develop a policy of selecting the optimal bandit at each time step.  Since we are in case A with probability 0.5 and case B with probability 0.5, the total expectation value in this situation is ![$0.5 \times 0.2 + 0.5 \times 0.9 = 0.55$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%240.5%20%5Ctimes%200.2%20%2B%200.5%20%5Ctimes%200.9%20%3D%200.55%24).
